The cloud is perfect for hosting static websites that only include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that require no server-side processing. In this project, you will deploy a static website to AWS.

First, you will create an S3 bucket, configure the bucket for website hosting, and secure it using IAM policies.

Next, you will upload the website files to your bucket and speed up content delivery using AWSâ€™s content distribution network service, CloudFront.

Lastly, you will access your website in a browser using the unique S3 endpoint.

You should take a screenshot the results of each of your steps and submit the screenshots in a zipped folder when you are done.
